//#1: Extreme Case Validation
//• Test with negative numbers for x and y
//• Test with x larger than the width
//• Test withy larger than the height
//• Test with a completely full board
//• Test with an empty or nearly empty board
//• Test with far more white pieces than black
//• Test with far more black pieces than white

//#2: General Testing:
